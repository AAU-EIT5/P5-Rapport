In order to fly a drone indoors, there has to be a way to ensure that it doesn't collide with obstacles, and ensure that it can reliably navigate from its current position to a single, or a series of destinations. Usually this could be done by using GPS or similar systems, but indoors this isn't a reliable option as the signal is blocked by the building, and even if it was available, the precision would be too low to navigate hallways with.\\
This means another way to safely navigate a drone indoors has to be developed, preferably a self contained system making the drone independent on which building it's placed in.
In this project the group have decided to navigate indoors by using the walls and floor as reference surfaces.
