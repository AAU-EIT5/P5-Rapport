Throughout the design part of the project, the block diagram in figure \ref{fig:block_diagram} will be used as a walk-through to cover all the interfaces between all the components.

The control diagram consists of a controller part and drone part. As it can be seen on the system above, the drone will be controlled by a RF controller using a transmitter. The transmitter communicates with the receiver on the drone by RF communication. The desired position received by the receiver will be compared with the measured data from the distance sensors. If necessary the output will be adjusted first or it will be sent to the flight controller. This entirely process in drone part is handled by an arduino. From the flight controller the motors will be controlled as desired. The different blocks and communications will be described in detail in the following sections.
