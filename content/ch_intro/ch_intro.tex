The popularity of drones rises more and more today both for hobby and industrial use. The most of the applications of drones are for outdoor purposes, which is regulated by government laws and it can not be flown without a drone license.  It will be very expensive and difficult to get the license. In addition, when flying the drone outdoor it will be flown up at a height where there is almost nothing besides birds and other drones. The chances for collisions outdoor is not that huge as it will when flying the drone indoor.  
It is a new and difficult challenge for a indoor drone to follow a predefined route without any collisions. As an advantage there are no government regulations at the moment. The focus of this project will therefore be on indoor drones with the purpose of avoid as much as collesion as possible
