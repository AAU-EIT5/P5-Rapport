In order to fly a drone indoors, there has to be a way to ensure that it doesn't collide with obstacles, and ensure that it can reliably navigate from its current position to a single or a series of destinations. 
To make it possible to safely navigate a drone indoors there has to be developed a self contained system making the drone independent on which building it is placed in.
In this project the group have decided to navigate indoors by using the walls and floor as reference surfaces.
