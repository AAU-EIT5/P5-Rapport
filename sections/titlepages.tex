  The goal with this project is to make a visual bubble around the chosen quadcopter, to prevent the drone to crash in to objects. There have been installed distance sensors on the drone, to have the height of the drone at all time. These sensors will be used as a way to make the visual bubble around the drone. 
  
  To make the avoidance system, needs a control unit to handle the flying. For this controller to be constructed a transfer function. The transfer function is made from a step response of the drone. 
  From the step response the transfer function were found and proportional controller were designed. The drone was fitted with a Teensy 3.2 to run the program for the avoidance system. 
  
  The final test of the drone, showed that the system works, but it also reveals that the model for the drone might have been found the wrong way. There were not time to correct this error in this project, there for the discussion will have more about some of the probably solutions for the error.
