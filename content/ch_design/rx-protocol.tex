\section{Communications}\label{s:coms}
In order to control the drone, there has to be a way to transmit commands to the drone. This can be anything from simple commands like "arm motors" or complicated commands like streaming movement commands to the flight-controller on the drone.
This section will go over a few different physical layers, and will then go in detail with.

\subsection*{Proprietary TX RX pair}\label{ss:rc-txrx}
One very common solution for radio controlled devices to communicate, is over a proprietary RF link. These systems have a remote control as the transmitter (TX) that the operator use to control the drone, and the drone then has a receiver (RX) that outputs command to the drones flight-controller.
\newline
In order to modify this signal, there are few places to break in to the signal and modify it. One could rewrite the firmware for the flight-controller, but this is out of scope for our project. This only leaves options that tap into the signal, modify it, and send the modified signal to the drone.
This can either be done in the RF signal, in the controller hardware, or between the RX and flight-controller. 

We have chosen to tap in between the RX and flight-controller, as this is the only place to tap in, that's standardized, and this following sections will detail the protocols used here.\\

\subsection*{Drones radio frequency specification}
In this section the RF speficaition for drone will be examined. 

\begin{table}[H] \label{tab:RFSpec}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}

\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{RF Specifications for communication between controller and the drone}}                               \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
The RF specification in table \ref{tab:RFSpec} system works within 2.405 to 2.475 GHz. There is 142 channels and each have 500 KHz bandwidth. For each transmitter there is unique ID, when the transmitter is connected to the receiver, the receiver will save the transmitters ID, and this way the receiver will avoid other transmitter signal.
AFHDS2A, which stands for Automatic frequency hopping digital system 2A is used for radio frequency mode. This means AFHDS2A has the automatic identification function, which switches automatically in current mode between single-way communication mode and two-way communication mode. The AFHDS2A have multiple and error-correction built it, this improves the stability of the communication and reduces the error ratio and extend the reliable transmission distance. The drones transmitter and receiver can be found in datasheet.










\subsection*{RX protocols}\label{ss:rxprotococls} 
The RX connects to the flight-controller, using one or more channels where each channel carries a control signal for a function on the drone. These channels can either be transmitted over one wire each, using PWM to express the value of the channel, or they can all be transmitted over one wire, using PPM or other serial protocols to express the value of each channel.\\

    \label{fig:chan_pwm}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]

    \label{fig:chan_ppm}
\end{figure}
  %\todo{Redo figure for PPM, I have no source for the current one.}
  
With PPM, values are sent sequentially. Before the first channel is sent, a long "End of frame" pause is sent, holding the data-line low. This ends with a pulse, signifying start of channel1 value. Some time later, a second pulse signifies end of channel1 value, and start of channel2 value. This pattern continues until all channels have been sent, after which the "End of frame" pause is sent again.

A common problem with PWM and PPM based transmission of channel values, is that these methods encode the channel values as time between pulses of one sort or another, this means they are susceptible to jitter in the clocks on both the transmitting and receiving system.\\
In order to solve this, other serial protocols can be considered.
One such serial protocol is used internally in the receiver used on our drone. The protocol is called flySky iBUS, and is a variation of the very common RS232 serial protocol. The data-rate is fixed at 115200 baud, with 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit, or 8N1.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{figures/ch_design/iBUS.png}
    \caption{A single iBUS packet}
    \label{fig:iBUS}
\end{figure}

As shown on figure \ref{fig:iBUS} an iBUS packet consists of a header-byte then 28 bytes, carrying 14 16-bit values, followed by a simple 2B checksum. The checksum is a sum of all 14 values transmitted.

Due to the benefits that iBUS caries over PWM and PPM, this is the protocol we have decided to further use in our project.

\subsection*{iBUS decoding and encoding}\label{iBUS library}

The code developed to decode and encode iBUS is available on our github\cite{ibus-lib}.
It was written as a generic Arduino library, and this section will document key functions from it.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Parser for iBUS packets}]
void iBus::m_parse_channels(uint8_t packet[], int ch[])
{
	// For each channel, store 2 bytes in 16bit integer
	// The values are sent MSb first, LSB first
	for(int i=0; i<m_channels_per_packet; i++)
	{
		ch[i] = packet[i*2+2] << 8 | packet[i*2+1];
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

This function loops over all channel bytes in an iBUS packet, and combines them into integers in internal array to the library, a simple getter is them provided for the main program, to get individual channels.

The reverse is done to build a packet for transmitting, as seen in the following function

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Function for constructing and transmitting for iBUS packets}]
void iBus::m_send_packet(int ch[])
{
	// Set up buffer and set header byte
	uint8_t buff[m_packet_size];
	buff[0] = 0x55;

	// For each channel, unpack 16 bit integer into bytes
	// The values are sent MSb first, LSB first.
	for(int i=0; i<m_channels_per_packet; i++)
	{
		buff[i*2+1] = (ch[i] & 0x00FF);
		buff[i*2+2] = (ch[i] >> 8);
	}
	int checksum = m_get_checksum(ch);

	buff[29] = (checksum & 0x00FF);
	buff[30] = (checksum >> 8);

	m_ser.write(buff, m_packet_size);
}
\end{lstlisting}

As seen in this function, constructing and sending an iBUS package is rather simple. the code allocates a buffer to hold a packet, sets the header-byte, and then splits apart the 14 channels supplied into individual bytes, arranged MSb, LSB first. this means a number such as 0x0102 would be sent as 0x02, 0x01.From here, the checksum is calculated, split into the same MSb, LSB first arrangement, and the whole buffer is written out over the allocated stream object m\_ser.

The function used to set which channel values are sent, is a simple setter function, setting the values of an internal out-put channel array, which is passed to m\_send\_packet\(\) each time the main ticker function handle\(\) is called.

the handle function is more easily described with a flow-chart, as it is a relatively long function, but it's tasks are fairly simple.
