\section{Initial Problem statement}\label{s:initial_problem}
How can a "safety bubble" be made for an off-the-shelf drone, so it is prevented from crashing into its surroundings?
\newline
To gain the proper knowledge to solve this problem, it is first needed to have knowledge of how a drone moves around in the air. Therefore the drone's physics is needed to be examined, this will be explained in the following chapters.
