\section{Initial Problem statement}\label{s:initial_problem}
How can a "safety bobble" be made for a off the shelf drone, so it is prevented to fly in to solid materials?
\newline
To gain the proper knowledge to solve this problem, it is first needed to have knowledge of how a drone move around in the air. Therefore the a drone's physics need to be explained.
