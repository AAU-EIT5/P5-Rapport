\section{Problem statement}\label{s:problem_statment}
Now when the common methods of controlling a drone have been explained, it shows that there is a need of more usable solutions to make the "safety bobble" around the drone. To make the problem more solvable, a small downsizing is needed, so if the drone can hold a specific distance to a wall or floor and follow it, it should be enough as a proof of concept.
\newline
So the problem that needs solved goes as:
How can a device be implemented on an off-the-shelf drone, so it is capable of keeping a specific distance to a surface and follow it as well?

%This project will focus on how to develop a remote controlled indoor drone with stability features. To avoid as many collisions as possible the drone will maintain a specific distance and angle to the wall and the ceiling .
